Instructions:
1. Run the main.go file and open the file uploading page at localhost:9090/upload

Assumptions:
1. The file passed to the server must be valid.
2. The file ends with EOL character
3. I am currently using the bufio package Readline() to read lines, so the same assumptions regarding
line length apply.
