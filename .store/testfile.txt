I would like you to produce a small serverlet (no UI required) that accepts as input a body of text, such as that from a book, and returns the top ten most-used words along with how many times they occur in the text.
This task should be completed using GoLang and uploaded to GitHub, when you are done just send me a link to the repo and I will review it As.
